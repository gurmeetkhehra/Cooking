        <h3>Dinner Ideas</h3>
        <p>Dhaba Style Chicken Curry.A simple Chicken Curry, which is served in almost all the 
           roadside non-veg highway dhabas of North India. This chicken curry has the simplest
           of ingredients such as whole spices, ginger, garlic, onions, tomatoes and curd. 
           I also love to make this Chicken Curry for my family get-togethers and house
           parties, and it is always a hit.</p>

        <p>Gulab jamun are soft delicious berry sized balls made of milk solids, flour & a 
            leavening agent. These are soaked in rose flavored sugar syrup & enjoyed. The word
            “Gulab” translates to rose in hindi & “jamun” to berry. So gulab jamun are berry 
            sized balls dunked in rose flavored sugar syrup.</p>
